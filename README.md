# **MotionAIO**

MotionAIO was a bot for the popular NFT platform VeVe, which sniped NFTS on the marketplace that were listed for under value. I decided to open-source this project because the demand for VeVe automation drastically decreased over the past year, and I thought it would be helpful for others to learn from. The code is not in a working state as the API that was used is no longer being paid for, and the logs are very outdated.
