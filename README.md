MotionAIO

This was a project i worked on a while back, MotionAIO was a bot for the popular NFT platform VeVe which sniped NFTS on the marketplace that were listed for under value. I decided to open source this project as the demand for VeVe autmoation drastically decreassed over the past year and thought it would be helpful for others to learn from. The code is not in a working state as the API that was used is no longer being paid for and the logs are very outdated.
